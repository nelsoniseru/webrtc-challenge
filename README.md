**How To Run The Application:**

- cd into webrtc-challenge folder and type the command on your terminal "yarn install"  to install all the packages required for angular frontend  after then you use "yarn start" to start the frontend server.
- cd into server folder and type the command on your terminal "yarn install" to install all the packages required for nodejs server after then you use "yarn start" to start the server.

**Challenge: Build a real-time communication system using WebRTC technology.**

- The platform should support video and audio calls
- The platform should be able to handle multiple concurrent users and sessions.
- The platform should be able to handle potential network interruptions and reconnections.
- The platform should be built using Angular (with TypeScript), HTML, and Angular Material UI or Pure CSS
- Use backend technology to build your signaling server (preferably node, deno, or any python web framework)

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Functionality: Can the platform handle video and audio calls with multiple users?
- Scalability: Can the platform handle multiple concurrent users and sessions?
- Resilience: Can the platform handle potential network interruptions and reconnections?
- Code Quality: Is the code readable, maintainable, and well-organized?
